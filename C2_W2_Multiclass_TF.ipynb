The axes in these plots are the outputs of the previous layer $a^{[1]}_0$ and $a^{[1]}_1$.

It is not sufficient for a unit to produce a maximum value for the class it is selecting for, it must also be the highest value of all the units for points in that class. This is done by the implied softmax function that is part of the loss function (`SparseCategoricalCrossEntropy`). Unlike other activation functions, the softmax works across all the outputs.\n",
