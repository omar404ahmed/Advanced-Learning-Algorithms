Neuron without activation - Regression/Linear Model
DataSet
We'll use an example from Course 1, linear regression on house prices.



X_train = np.array([[1.0], [2.0]], dtype=np.float32)           #(size in 1000 square feet)
Y_train = np.array([[300.0], [500.0]], dtype=np.float32)       #(price in 1000s of dollars)

fig, ax = plt.subplots(1,1)
ax.scatter(X_train, Y_train, marker='x', c='r', label="Data Points")
ax.legend( fontsize='xx-large')
ax.set_ylabel('Price (in 1000s of dollars)', fontsize='xx-large')
ax.set_xlabel('Size (1000 sqft)', fontsize='xx-large')
plt.show()



Regression/Linear Model
The function implemented by a neuron with no activation is the same as in Course 1, linear regression:
𝑓𝐰,𝑏(𝑥(𝑖))=𝐰⋅𝑥(𝑖)+𝑏(1)
We can define a layer with one neuron or unit and compare it to the familiar linear regression function.



linear_layer = tf.keras.layers.Dense(units=1, activation = 'linear', )

Let's examine the weights.
linear_layer.get_weights()
There are no weights as the weights are not yet instantiated. Let's try the model on one example in X_train. This will trigger the instantiation of the weights. Note, the input to the layer must be 2-D, so we'll reshape it.

a1 = linear_layer(X_train[0].reshape(1,1))
print(a1)
The result is a tensor (another name for an array) with a shape of (1,1) or one entry.
Now let's look at the weights and bias. These weights are randomly initialized to small numbers and the bias defaults to being initialized to zero.

w, b= linear_layer.get_weights()
print(f"w = {w}, b={b}")
A linear regression model (1) with a single input feature will have a single weight and bias. This matches the dimensions of our linear_layer above.
The weights are initialized to random values so let's set them to some known values.

set_w = np.array([[200]])
set_b = np.array([100])

# set_weights takes a list of numpy arrays
linear_layer.set_weights([set_w, set_b])
print(linear_layer.get_weights())
Let's compare equation (1) to the layer output.

a1 = linear_layer(X_train[0].reshape(1,1))
print(a1)
alin = np.dot(set_w,X_train[0].reshape(1,1)) + set_b
print(alin)
They produce the same values! Now, we can use our linear layer to make predictions on our training data.

prediction_tf = linear_layer(X_train)
prediction_np = np.dot( X_train, set_w) + set_b

plt_linear(X_train, Y_train, prediction_tf, prediction_np)
Neuron with Sigmoid activation
The function implemented by a neuron/unit with a sigmoid activation is the same as in Course 1, logistic regression:
𝑓𝐰,𝑏(𝑥(𝑖))=𝑔(𝐰𝑥(𝑖)+𝑏)(2)
where
𝑔(𝑥)=𝑠𝑖𝑔𝑚𝑜𝑖𝑑(𝑥)
Let's set 𝑤 and 𝑏 to some known values and check the model.
DataSet
We'll use an example from Course 1, logistic regression.

X_train = np.array([0., 1, 2, 3, 4, 5], dtype=np.float32).reshape(-1,1)  # 2-D Matrix
Y_train = np.array([0,  0, 0, 1, 1, 1], dtype=np.float32).reshape(-1,1)  # 2-D Matrix

pos = Y_train == 1
neg = Y_train == 0
X_train[pos]

pos = Y_train == 1
neg = Y_train == 0
​
fig,ax = plt.subplots(1,1,figsize=(4,3))
ax.scatter(X_train[pos], Y_train[pos], marker='x', s=80, c = 'red', label="y=1")
ax.scatter(X_train[neg], Y_train[neg], marker='o', s=100, label="y=0", facecolors='none', 
              edgecolors=dlc["dlblue"],lw=3)
​
ax.set_ylim(-0.08,1.1)
ax.set_ylabel('y', fontsize=12)
ax.set_xlabel('x', fontsize=12)
ax.set_title('one variable plot')
ax.legend(fontsize=12)
plt.show()
Logistic Neuron
We can implement a 'logistic neuron' by adding a sigmoid activation. The function of the neuron is then described by (2) above.
This section will create a Tensorflow Model that contains our logistic layer to demonstrate an alternate method of creating models. Tensorflow is most often used to create multi-layer models. The Sequential model is a convenient means of constructing these models.

model = Sequential(
    [
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, input_dim=1,  activation = 'sigmoid', name='L1')
    ]
)
model.summary() shows the layers and number of parameters in the model. There is only one layer in this model and that layer has only one unit. The unit has two parameters, 𝑤 and 𝑏.

model.summary()

logistic_layer = model.get_layer('L1')
w,b = logistic_layer.get_weights()
print(w,b)
print(w.shape,b.shape)
Let's set the weight and bias to some known values.

set_w = np.array([[2]])
set_b = np.array([-4.5])
# set_weights takes a list of numpy arrays
logistic_layer.set_weights([set_w, set_b])
print(logistic_layer.get_weights())
Let's compare equation (2) to the layer output.

a1 = model.predict(X_train[0].reshape(1,1))
print(a1)
alog = sigmoidnp(np.dot(set_w,X_train[0].reshape(1,1)) + set_b)
print(alog)
They produce the same values! Now, we can use our logistic layer and NumPy model to make predictions on our training data.

plt_logistic(X_train, Y_train, model, set_w, set_b, pos, neg)
The shading above reflects the output of the sigmoid which varies from 0 to 1.
Congratulations!
